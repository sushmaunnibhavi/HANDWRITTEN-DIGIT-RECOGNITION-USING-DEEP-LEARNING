#Handwritten digit recognition using convolutional neural networks(CNN)
#Here we are traininng a multi level neural network to recognize the digits
#Here we are using a database called MNIST which contains 60000 handwritten digits with their labels
#After training the neural network,it should now classify the new image correctly


#Step 1:download the database of images from MNIST
#Step 2:set up a neural network with required number of layers and nodes and train the network
#Step 3:feed the training data to the neural network
#Step 4:we will check what the output will be like for one image
#Step 5:feed the test data set of 10000 images to trained neural network and check its accuracy


#Step 1:
